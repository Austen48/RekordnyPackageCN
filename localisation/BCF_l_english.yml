Now that we have solved most of our internal problems, it is time to look abroad. As one of our neighbors, Anzio's position has been fluctuating and we must ensure that the situation on the ground is under our control to ensure security along our southern border."
 bcfreedom.8.a:0 "We need a stable Anzio"

 bcfreedom.9.t:0 "Piedmont or War"
 bcfreedom.9.d:0 "We received an ultimatum from Paris, which struck a defiant tone, demanding that we immediately surrender the Piedmont region or that peace between the two countries cease to exist. This is undoubtedly an unwarranted infringement of our sovereignty, but we must also take into account the gap in strength between the two sides. We don't have much time left.

 bcfreedom.21.t:0 "Second Orleans Conference"
 bcfreedom.21.d:0 "On Feb. 1, 1972, delegates from all over the school returned to Orleans — a city that once held the banner of a holy woman. Union leaders, Brittany's royalists, right-wing southern groups and Paris tycoons... ... It's hard to imagine anyone capable of bringing so many different political views together, but this dreamlike scenario has actually happened in this city, and for the second time in the history of this school. At the center of the meeting was the petite teenager seated onstage, without a hint of childish air, glancing down at the crowd with a gritty stare. She was the backbone of BC Freedom Academy, the new-age saint, and the leader of France, Marie. Alas, the exterior doesn't disguise the fact that the so-called head of state is no different from the kings of more than a thousand years ago — she is just the princess of France, struggling to hold on to a long-overburdened school with her own prestige and the tanks of BC Freedom. Whether her career can continue will depend entirely on this conference."
 bcfreedom.21.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 bcfreedom.22.t:0 "What Marie said"
 bcfreedom.22.d:0 "Marie slowly rose, solemnly declared the beginning of the meeting, and with the Tricolor and the Marseillaise, the wheels of BC's fate were about to begin to turn. Once again, Marie reiterated her "BC is not divided" position, that no one, from Brittany to Alsace-Lorraine, from Calais to Corsica, should be allowed to separate even an inch of territory by any means. Of course, she can make as many compromises as she can to keep the school stable — though there are enough at this stage."

 bcfreedom.23.t:0 "Construction project"

 bcfreedom.24.t:0 "President Andou's speech"
 bcfreedom.24.d:0 "After Marie, it was Andou — the leader of BC's liberal out-of-school enrollments — who took the stage. From the bottom of society, she was ridiculed and despised on campus by the helicopter's ladies and gentlemen, but she was well regarded by others. She has already organized demonstrations by out-of-school enrollees at the school in a bid to promote a more "equal" campus. Marie was not convinced of her behavior, perhaps for the sake of stability inside the school. At meetings, she speaks up for the underclass and restores BC to its former glory, favored by union representatives and nationalists but often beholden to the grandeur."
 bcfreedom.24.a:0 "Good point!"
 bcfreedom.24.b:0 "The great BC school needs such a leader"

 bcfreedom.25.t:0 "The Moseland Problem"
 bcfreedom.25.d:0 "The Moseland region was incorporated into French territory as a trophy of World War II, but its inhabitants have long failed to embrace French rule, and the increasingly frequent separatist movements have made governance more costly for the BC Freedom government. The hot potato has been suggested as an opportunity for the Orleans meeting to be thrown out, but it will undoubtedly lose its most important leverage over Kuromorimine diplomacy."
 bcfreedom.25.a:0 "The priority isn't this"
 bcfreedom.25.b:0 "Expansion of the Gendarmerie and police"
 bcfreedom.26.t:0 "Military construction"
 bcfreedom.26.d:0 "There is always nothing wrong with maintaining a modern and powerful army at any time, and there is rare agreement among the parties. But what should we prioritize?"
 bcfreedom.26.a:0 "The Army, of course"
 bcfreedom.26.b:0 "Naval priority"
 bcfreedom.26.c:0 "The one who rules the sky rules the world"
 bcfreedom.26.d:0 "I want everything"
 bcfreedom.27.t:0 "A speech by Yasuda"
 bcfreedom.27.d:0 "After Andou, Ms Oshida, the leader of BC's liberal wing, rose to speak. As a representative of the school's heliport, she has nothing to say about Andou out of school, but because of Marie's authority, she has yet to eliminate her rivals completely — if she becomes the school's leader. As the daughter of an entrepreneur, she was naturally supported by the Bourgeois in the meeting."
 bcfreedom.27.a:0 "BC needs this kind of leadership!"
 bcfreedom.27.b:0 "Come on. What's a capitalist's daughter gonna do?"
 bcfreedom.28.t:0 "Who will rule?"
 bcfreedom.28.d:0 "On the last day of the General Assembly, there is only one last question left to be voted on: To whom will the school be put?"
 bcfreedom.28.a:0 "Miss Marie, the meeting has been studied and decided. Please do it again!"
 bcfreedom.28.b:0 "Andou will lead us to prosperity."
 bcfreedom.28.c:0 "Yasuda should be on stage"
 bcfreedom.29.t:0 "Inauguration"
 bcfreedom.29.d:0 "BC's newly elected leader has been sworn in in Orleans, hoping that she will lead us to prosperity."
 bcfreedom.29.a:0 "I hope so"
 bcfreedom.30.t:0 "BC's Senshadou League"
 bcfreedom.30.d:0 "The French Senshadou League, a joint event between BC Freedom and Maginot College, has attracted national attention. But the two schools were hostile from the start. The Maginot Institute, which disagreed with BC's liberal dominance of France, should have taken its place, and Maginot has taken firm control of the Burgundy region as a base for confrontation with the Paris government. The Senshadou League was originally intended to smooth things over between the two schools, but whether it would backfire is unclear."
 bcfreedom.30.a:0 "Let the game begin"
 bcfreedom.31.t:0 "BC Freedom Academy wins!"
 bcfreedom.31.d:0 "The match was so intense that the two sides were left fighting each other to the flag. In the end, the BC Freedom Academy destroyed its opponent by surprise and won the match."
 bcfreedom.31.a:0 "Panzer Vor!"
 bcfreedom.32.t:0 "Maginot Girls' College Wins!"
 bcfreedom.32.d:0 "We were defeated by the enemy, and the flag tank was destroyed by the enemy with astonishing accuracy in the first round."
 bcfreedom.32.a:0 "How did this happen?"
 bcfreedom.33.t:0 "Order restored in Maginot?"
 bcfreedom.33.d:0 "We have restored order in the Burgundy region, but the local Maginot Party has still not surrendered to us, and we may not be able to use local resources effectively for a long time."
 bcfreedom.33.a:0 "At least we won..."
 bcfreedom.34.t:0 "Maginot agrees to autonomy"
 bcfreedom.34.d:0 "From Dijon, the Maginot Institute has agreed terms on which we will allow them autonomy, and they will still be considered part of France。"
 bcfreedom.34.a:0 "Better than civil war."
 bcfreedom.35.t:0 "Maginot refused"
 bcfreedom.35.d:0 "Word from Dijon is that Maginot has arrogantly refused our request for leniency, leaving them with only one option left if they are completely dealt with."
 bcfreedom.35.a:0 "We have more important matters to attend to."
 bcfreedom.35.b:0 "Then War it is."
 bcfreedom.36.t:0 "Formation of a coalition government"
 bcfreedom.36.d:0 "The Maginot side has agreed to our demand for a coalition government, and by giving them a place in politics, we have succeeded in ensuring peace and stability in the school — hopefully."
 bcfreedom.36.a:0 "So... Does it really work?"
 bcfreedom.37.t:0 "BC Freedom to Request Civil War Support"
 bcfreedom.37.d:0 "BC Freedom's secret mission has arrived in China in the hope of restoring the two schools' long-standing friendship and opening up extensive cooperation. They also asked if it was possible to help BC's free and legitimate government confront its enemies at home — should "emergency" occur."
 bcfreedom.37.a:0 "We will do our utmost to help BC."
 bcfreedom.37.b:0 "We can help them, but their internal problems are none of our business."
 bcfreedom.37.c:0 "Help the French? It's worse than no black tea!"
 bcfreedom.38.t:0 "St. Gloriana agrees to provide full support."
 bcfreedom.38.d:0 "St. Gloriana replied with a promise to help us at all costs!"
 bcfreedom.38.a:0 "The friendship between BC and St. Gloriana has lasted for a long time!"
 bcfreedom.39.t:0 "St. Gloriana agrees to limited support."
 bcfreedom.39.d:0 "Although St. Gloriana agreed to help, they didn't want to get mixed up in our internal affairs"
 bcfreedom.39.a:0 "Better than nothing"
 bcfreedom.40.t:0 "Saint Gloriana refuses aid"
 bcfreedom.40.d:0 "A scornful reply came from across the channel, and St. Gloriana had no interest in our proposal. We are on our own."
 bcfreedom.40.a:0 "Damn those tea loving freaks"
 bcfreedom.41.t:0 "BC Freedom seeks new Senshadou alliance"
 bcfreedom.41.d:0 "Should we agree to the BC Freedom Government's proposal to our country to restructure the collapsed Senshadou Alliance?"
 bcfreedom.41.a:0 "Agreed"
 bcfreedom.41.b:0 "Reject"
 bcfreedom.42.t:0 "Rebuilding the Senshadou Alliance"
 bcfreedom.42.d:0 "The dissolution of the Senshadou Alliance is a devastating blow to our international standing, and if we want to continue to maintain the existing order of events we need to carry the banner of the Senshadou Alliance again as guardians of Europe, and we should issue a broad invitation regardless of the past."
 bcfreedom.42.a:0 "To rebuild the alliance, we are obliged to do so!"
 bcfreedom.43.t:0 "Kuromorimine Girls' Academy agrees to join the alliance"
 bcfreedom.43.d:0 "Kuromorimine has agreed to join the new alliance, and we will work together towards tomorrow."
 bcfreedom.43.a:0 "Great!"
 bcfreedom.44.t:0 "Kuromorimine Girls' Academy refuses to join the alliance"
 bcfreedom.44.d:0 "Kuromorimine has refused to join the new alliance. Wheather they have alternative plans, or they dont view us as a trustworthy alliy remains to be seen."
 bcfreedom.44.a:0 "All right"
 bcfreedom.45.t:0 "St. Gloriana agrees to join the Alliance"
 bcfreedom.45.d:0 "St. Gloriana has agreed to join the new alliance, and we will work together towards tomorrow."
 bcfreedom.45.a:0 "Great!"
 bcfreedom.46.t:0 "St. Gloriana Girls' College refuses to join the League"
 bcfreedom.46.d:0 "St. Gloriana has refused to join the alliance. Our Stalwart friendship may not as strong as we originally believed"
 bcfreedom.46.a:0 "Treacherous tea lovers. "
 bcfreedom.47.t:0 "Pravada Girls' High School agrees to join the alliance"
 bcfreedom.47.d:0 "Pravada has agreed to join the new alliance, and we will walk hand in hand into tomorrow."
 bcfreedom.47.a:0 "Great!"
 bcfreedom.48.t:0 "Pravada Girls' High School refuses to join the alliance"
 bcfreedom.48.d:0 "Earlier today we've recived a message from Pravada Girls' High School, stating they refuse to join our alliance."
 bcfreedom.48.a:0 "Of course they would What did we expect?"
 bcfreedom.49.t:0 "Anzio High School agrees to join the alliance"

 bcfreedom.54.t:0 "Bonple High School refuses to join the alliance"
 bcfreedom.54.d:0 "We've received a reply from Bonple, stating they refuse to join our new alliance. They believe they will not benefit to such agreements"
 bcfreedom.54.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 bcfreedom.55.t:0 "Anzio succumbs"
 bcfreedom.55.d:0 "The news came from Rome before the ultimatum that they decided, after a difficult choice, to surrender Piedmont in exchange for a precious independence. This is a sign of our renewed strength!"
 bcfreedom.55.a:0 "Glad we have an understanding."
 bcfreedom.56.t:0 "Anzio declined"
 bcfreedom.56.d:0 "Anzio has rejected all our demands and said something about it being an unjustified violation of their sovereignty. What you can't get at the negotiating table you can only get by tanks。"
 bcfreedom.56.a:0 "They asked for it!, order our tanks cross the border."
 bcfreedom.56.b:0 "Forget it, its not worth the effort."
 bcfreedom.57.t:0 "Victory in Northern Italy"
 bcfreedom.57.d:0 "With our tanks crossing the Alps and successfully capturing the three major Anzio towns in Northern Italy - Turin, Milan and Genoa - we have fully achieved our stated strategic objectives. Is it still necessary for us to carry the war forward?"
 bcfreedom.57.a:0 "Halt the tanks, there is no need for more bloodshed."
 bcfreedom.57.b:0 "Forward! We will hold a victory celebration in Rome!"
 bcfreedom.58.t:0 "Anzio agrees."
 bcfreedom.58.d:0 "Under our tempting conditions, Anzio agreed to surrender Piedmont in exchange for our protection of them, a great victory for our diplomacy!"
 bcfreedom.58.a:0 "Very good"
 bcfreedom.59.t:0 "Kuromorimine Girls' Academy agrees to pay out"
 bcfreedom.59.d:0 "Kurmorimine agreed to the demand for a large indemnity in exchange for the Moseran territories under our control, and we will use this large sum of money to rebuild our school."
 bcfreedom.59.a:0 "With money, everything is good."
 bcfreedom.60.t:0 "Kuromorimine refuses to pay benefits"
 bcfreedom.60.d:0 "With Hessian Peak refusing to pay any war reparations, it seems that there is no need for the negotiations to continue."
 bcfreedom.60.a:0 "Go back, we can't talk to the Germans."
 bcfreedom.61.t:0 "Territory Returns"
 bcfreedom.61.d:0 "With the Treaty of Luxembourg, Moseland has finally returned to the arms of Kuromorimine. Although it cost us a lot, it was worth it."
 bcfreedom.61.a:0 "Three cheers for Kuromorimine"
 bcfreedom.62.t:0 "Tea Party"
 bcfreedom.62.d:0 "Our country has established a socialist track, but it is geopolitically surrounded by various reactionary regimes. Pravda, although far away in Eastern Europe, would greatly reduce our pressure on the European continent if we could maintain good relations with it. The diplomatic service has arranged a tea party which will determine the future of the European revolution."
 bcfreedom.62.a:0 "Pack your bags and go meet the beautiful Katyusha!"
 bcfreedom.63.t:0 "BC Freedom Academy unconditionally Withdrawals"
 bcfreedom.63.d:0 "Surprising news from BC Freedom Academy! They are willing to withdraw without any strings attached from our territories occupied after the Great War as a cornerstone of a future friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The French-occupied German territories, long considered a national disgrace, will soon return and we are one step closer to being back on top!"
 bcfreedom.63.a:0 "This is great news!"
 bcfreedom.64.t:0 "Tea Party"
 bcfreedom.64.d:0 "The comrades from Paris have arrived in Moscow this morning, and as hosts we invited one another to a tea party, where we will discuss the future situation in Europe."

 bcfreedom.65.t:0 "The Revolutionary Situation"
 bcfreedom.65.d:0 "BC freedom and Pravda are located at opposite ends of the European continent, and there are many obstacles between the two schools. These rebel factions will not give in and will exhaust all methods to strangle the revolution. The two sides have successfully reached a consensus that they must unite and use the left hook of BC Freedom and the right hook of Pravda to crush all the regimes that oppress the people on the European continent."
 bcfreedom.65.a:0 "Talking with comrade Katyusha is a joy."
 bcfreedom.66.t:0 "Eastern European Issues"
 bcfreedom.66.d:0 "After talking about the revolutionary situation, the two sides turned their attention to the more realistic issue of Bonple High School, the other major victor of World War II. Pravda had always wanted to bring the fire of the revolution to Warsaw, but Bonple's close ties with our school were well known, and we had to take a stand on this issue; if we decided to continue to support Bonple it would be possible that the talks would be difficult to continue and that cooperation with Pravada would not be fully established."
 bcfreedom.66.a:0 "Pravda is reliable, we don't need to invest a lot of resources in Bonple High School anymore."
 bcfreedom.66.b:0 "Bonple is historically an ally of our school, and besides, who knows what will Pravda do?"
 bcfreedom.66.c:0 "We will discuss it later."
 bcfreedom.67.t:0 "BC Freedom Academy exit Eastern Europe"
 bcfreedom.67.d:0 "The BC Freedom government has informed us that they have decided to gradually withdraw from Eastern Europe and focus their attention elsewhere, so we can move westward with confidence!"
 bcfreedom.67.a:0 "Ullah!"
 bcfreedom.68.t:0 "The Kuromorimine Problem"
 bcfreedom.68.d:0 "Kuromorimine is a major foe of our school, and despite their heavy losses in the last great battle, they still have notable strength. We do not have enough strength to defeat them completely. If Pravda is willing to work with our school to isolate Kuromorimine, or simply remain neutral, both can greatly reduce our pressure."
 bcfreedom.68.a:0 "Ask Pravda to help us isolate Kuromorimine"
 bcfreedom.68.b:0 "Ask Pravda to be neutral"
 bcfreedom.69.t:0 "BC Freedom seeks cooperation against Kuromorimine"
 bcfreedom.69.d:0 "The BC Liberal government seeks cooperation between our two schools against Kuromorimine, which would undoubtedly cut off any possibility of our cooperation with Kuromorimine, but would BC be a more reliable ally?"
 bcfreedom.69.a:0 "No problem! we will be happy to lend BC a hand."
 bcfreedom.69.b:0 "Forget about it, they're about as reliable as a witch. What if they surrender again? "
 bcfreedom.70.t:0 "BC Freedom wants us to remain neutral"
 bcfreedom.70.d:0 "The French want us to remain neutral in their future war with Kuromorimine; do we agree to their request?"
 bcfreedom.70.a:0 "Of Course!"
 bcfreedom.70.b:0 "No, we will interveine whenever and wherever we choose."
 bcfreedom.71.t:0 "Pravda agrees to isolate Kuromorimine"
 bcfreedom.71.d:0 "Truth agrees to help us with Kuromorimine, by isolating our enemy."
 bcfreedom.71.a:0 "Just know that Pravda is our friend"
 bcfreedom.72.t:0 "Pravda agrees to stay neutral"
 bcfreedom.72.d:0 "Pravda has agreed to remain neutral, and we can now at least be assured that we won't see hordes of T-34s on the front lines."
 bcfreedom.72.a:0 "At least there is one less enemy"
 bcfreedom.73.t:0 "The end of the tea party"
 bcfreedom.73.d:0 "The pleasant tea party ended on a good footing, with both parties taking what they wanted, but it is not yet known how long the friendship will last."
 bcfreedom.73.a:0 "It's time to go home"
 bcfreedom.74.t:0 "Pravda rejects our offer"
 bcfreedom.74.d:0 "Pravda declined our offer, and it seems they have their own opinions about Kuromorimine."
 bcfreedom.74.a:0 "We'll talk about it later..."
 bcfreedom.75.t:0 "Andou faction demands more equal campus conditions"
 bcfreedom.75.d:0 "The external students, who are far worse off than the helicopter students in terms of financial resources and status on campus; and thus, suffer from bullying on campus. They submitted a joint letter asking the school to address their legitimate claims."
 bcfreedom.75.a:0 "Accept their requests"
 bcfreedom.75.b:0 "They're on their own. Things are not as bad as they say."
 bcfreedom.75.c:0 "Express support, but don't support them completely"
 bcfreedom.76.t:0 "The Ando faction takes to the streets!"
 bcfreedom.76.d:0 "Andou organized a huge number of students outside the entrance. students take to the streets to protest against the injustice of our school, we must respond!"
 bcfreedom.76.a:0 "Let's make peace"
 bcfreedom.76.b:0 "Crackdown on them."
