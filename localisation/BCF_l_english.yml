#events
 bcfreedom.1.t:0 "The Second Orleans Conference"
 bcfreedom.1.d:0 "On February 1, 1972, delegates from all over the country came once again to Orléans - the city where the banner of the Virgin once flew. Trade union leaders, royalists from Brittany, right-wing groups from the South and moguls from Paris ...... It is hard to imagine anyone capable of bringing together so many different political ideas, but this dreamlike scene did happen in this city, and for the second time in the country's history. At the center of the meeting was the petite young woman sitting on the stage, without a trace of childishness in her body, sweeping the crowd with that unmistakable steely gaze. Unfortunately, this appearance cannot hide the fact that this so-called head of state is no different from the kings of more than a thousand years ago - she is just the princess of the island of France, relying entirely on her prestige and the BC She is only the princess of the island of France, relying on her prestige and the tanks of freedom to maintain the country, which is already overburdened. Whether or not her career will continue to be Continuation will depend entirely on this meeting."
 bcfreedom.1.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 bcfreedom.2.t:0 "Marie's speech"
 bcfreedom.2.d:0 "Marie rose slowly and solemnly opened the meeting, and with the Tricolour and the Marseillaise, the wheels of France's destiny were about to turn. From Brittany to Alsace-Lorraine, from Calais to Corsica, no one was allowed to divide even one inch of territory by any means. Of course, she can make as many compromises as possible in order to maintain the stability of the country - although at this stage there are already enough compromises."
 bcfreedom.2.a:0 "The sky is the limit, and Miss Marie is the sun in our hearts."
 bcfreedom.2.b:0 "That's true, but we can't compromise anymore"
 bcfreedom.3.t:0 "Construction projects"
 bcfreedom.3.d:0 "The first item on the agenda of the meeting is to strengthen our industrial strength, and we can either focus on investing in projects in individual regions to get the most out of them, or we can have multiple regions share these funds on the principle that everyone gets a share."
 bcfreedom.3.a:0 "Balanced Development"
 bcfreedom.3.b:0 "Prioritize industrial construction in the South"
 bcfreedom.3.c:0 "prioritize northern industrial construction"
 bcfreedom.3.d:0 "Better to build ships"
 bcfreedom.3.e:0 "Keep this money"
 bcfreedom.4.t:0 "Ando's speech"
 bcfreedom.4.d:0 "After Marie, stepping up to the podium is Ando - the leader of BC Freedom's off-campus admissions school. Coming from the bottom of the social ladder, she is much ridiculed and despised by the helicopter school ladies on campus, but has a lot of prestige among the others. Marie is unconcerned about her actions, perhaps for the sake of stability within the school, and has organized several demonstrations for off-campus students to seek a more "equal" campus environment. At meetings, she was a voice for the underclass and restored France to its former glory, and was favored by union delegates and nationalists, but she was also often a thorn in the side of the elite."
 bcfreedom.4.a:0 "Well said!"
 bcfreedom.4.b:0 "The great French nation needs such leaders"
 bcfreedom.4.c:0 "There's no more bread to eat, so why not cake?"
 bcfreedom.5.t:0 "The Moserland problem"
 bcfreedom.5.d:0 "The Moserland region was incorporated into French territory as a spoil of World War II, but for a long time its inhabitants never really accepted French rule, and the increasingly frequent separatist movements made it more and more expensive for the French government to govern. Some offered to take the opportunity of the Orleans conference to throw away the hot potato altogether, but this would undoubtedly lose the most important leverage in diplomacy with Kuromorimine."
 bcfreedom.5.a:0 "That's not the priority right now."
 bcfreedom.5.b:0 "Expand the gendarmerie and police"
 bcfreedom.6.t:0 "army building"
 bcfreedom.6.d:0 "There is always nothing wrong with maintaining a modern and powerful army at all times, and there was a rare consensus among the conference parties on this. But what kind of army should we prioritize?"
 bcfreedom.6.a:0 "The army, of course."
 bcfreedom.6.b:0 "Navy first"
 bcfreedom.6.c:0 "Those who rule the skies rule the world"
 bcfreedom.6.d:0 "I want it all"
 bcfreedom.7.t:0 "Oshida's speech"
 bcfreedom.7.d:0 "After Ando, Oshida, the leader of the other faction of BC Freedom, rose to speak. As the representative of the helicopter faction on campus, she despises the off-campus enrolled Ando Party, but due to Marie's authority, she can't completely remove her opponent yet - if she becomes the school leader, that's another story. As the daughter of an entrepreneur, she has the natural support of the bourgeois in the conference."
 bcfreedom.7.a:0 "That's the kind of person France needs to lead!"
 bcfreedom.7.b:0 "Come on, what can the daughter of a capitalist do."
 bcfreedom.8.t:0 "Who will be in power?"
 bcfreedom.8.d:0 "The congress is on its last day and there is only one last question left to vote on: into whose hands will the country be handed?"
 bcfreedom.8.a:0 "Miss Marie, the convention has studied and decided, please serve another term!"
 bcfreedom.8.b:0 "Ando will lead us to be rich and strong."
 bcfreedom.8.c:0 "Oshida should come to power"
 bcfreedom.9.t:0 "Inauguration"
 bcfreedom.9.d:0 "France's newly elected leader has been sworn in at Orleans, let's hope she can lead us to prosperity."
 bcfreedom.9.a:0 "I hope so"
 bcfreedom.10.t:0 "France Senshado League"
 bcfreedom.10.d:0 "The French Senshado League is a joint tournament between BC Freedom and the Maginot Academy, and is watched with national interest. But there has been animosity between these two colleges from the beginning. The Maginot Academy did not agree with BC Free's dominance of France and should take its place, and Maginot already had a firm grip on the Burgundy region as a stronghold against the Parisian government. This Senshado league was originally organized to ease relations between the two schools, but it is not clear whether it will backfire."
 bcfreedom.10.a:0 "Let the games begin"
 bcfreedom.11.t:0 "BC Freedom wins!"
 bcfreedom.11.d:0 "The race went very close, with both teams battling it out until only the flag car was left. In the end, the BC Freedom side was able to destroy their opponents without any risk and won the race."
 bcfreedom.11.a:0 "Hooray!"
 bcfreedom.12.t:0 "Maginot wins!"
 bcfreedom.12.d:0 "We were defeated, and the flag car was destroyed by the enemy with extreme accuracy in the first round of the encounter!"
 bcfreedom.12.a:0 "How did that happen?"
 bcfreedom.13.t:0 "Sibling rivalry!"
 bcfreedom.13.d:0 "As the game ended, the conflict between the two sides not only did not ease but escalated and soon evolved from a quarrel to a brawl, someone had even loaded live ammunition into the tank's magazine, luckily it was discovered in time and did not evolve into a real tank battle. But in any case, the apparent peace between BC Freedom and Maginot has ended once and for all."
 bcfreedom.13.a:0 "What happens next?"
 bcfreedom.14.t:0 "Maginot declares independence!"
 bcfreedom.14.d:0 "The College of Maginot severed all ties with Paris the day after the tournament, and the Burgundy region has become a complete country within a country. There are reports that the Burgundy region has begun to mobilize, and we must prepare for the worst, though there seems to be room for negotiation on things."
 bcfreedom.14.a:0 "How dare they?"
 bcfreedom.15.t:0 "Maginot order restored?"
 bcfreedom.15.d:0 "We have restored order in Burgundy, but the local Maginot remnants still have not surrendered to us, and we may not be able to use the local resources effectively for quite some time."
 bcfreedom.15.a:0 "At least we won ....."
 bcfreedom.16.t:0 "coalition government"
 bcfreedom.16.d:0 "As we planned, we will send Maginot an offer to form a coalition government - that's the biggest concession we can allow, and if the other side agrees we will be able to avoid civil war."

 bcfreedom.161.t:0 "BC Freedom's offer"
 bcfreedom.161.d:0 "BC Freedom wants to form a coalition government with us to resolve the current crisis, how should we respond?"
 bcfreedom.161.a:0 "Our purpose has been achieved"
 bcfreedom.161.b:0 "We will not give in"
 bcfreedom.17.t:0 "Maginot has refused"
 bcfreedom.17.d:0 "Word has come from Dijon that Maginot has arrogantly refused our lenient demands and there is only one way left if we are to settle them once and for all."
 bcfreedom.17.a:0 "We have more important things to deal with."
 bcfreedom.17.b:0 "Declare war!"
 bcfreedom.18.t:0 "The formation of a coalition government"
 bcfreedom.18.d:0 "The Maginot side has agreed to our request to form a coalition government, and by giving them a place in the political arena, we have succeeded in securing peace and stability for the country - hopefully."
 bcfreedom.18.a:0 "So ...... Does it really work"
 bcfreedom.19.t:0 "Enlist SaintGloriana's support"
 bcfreedom.19.d:0 "We have sent missions to the other side of the strait in the hope that the two sides will be united again under the banner of democracy.

 bcfreedom_stg.1.a:0 "We will do our best to help the French"
 bcfreedom_stg.1.b:0 "We can help them, but their internal problems are none of our business."

 bcfreedom_stg.2.t:0 "SaintGloriana agrees to full support"
 bcfreedom_stg.2.d:0 "SaintGloriana gave a reply and they promised to help us at all costs!"
 bcfreedom_stg.2.a:0 "The Anglo-French friendship lasts forever!"
 bcfreedom_stg.3.t:0 "SaintGloriana has agreed to limited support"
 bcfreedom_stg.3.d:0 "Although SaintGloriana has agreed to assist, they do not want to get involved in our internal conflicts"
 bcfreedom_stg.3.a:0 "It's better than nothing"
 bcfreedom_stg.4.t:0 "SaintGloriana refused assistance"
 bcfreedom_stg.4.d:0 "A contemptuous reply came from across the strait, SaintGloriana has no interest in our offer, we are on our own."

 bcfreedom_diplo.1.d:0 "We have received an ultimatum from Paris, in which the other side demands in a strong tone that we hand over the Piedmont region immediately, otherwise peace between the two countries will cease to exist. This is undoubtedly an unjustified violation of our sovereignty, but we must also take into account the difference in power between the two sides. There is not much time left for us, we must make a decision immediately!"

 bcfreedom_diplo.2.t:0 "Anzio gave in"
 bcfreedom_diplo.2.d:0 "The news came from Rome before the ultimatum, they decided after a hard choice to surrender Piedmont in exchange for their precious independence. This is a sign of our country's strength!"

 bcfreedom_diplo.3.t:0 "Anzio refused"
 bcfreedom_diplo.3.d:0 "The Roman side has rejected all our demands and said something about it being an unjustified violation of their sovereignty. What you can't get at the negotiating table you'll have to get by the tank."

 bcfreedom_kga_issue.1.d:0 "We had a meeting with Kuromorimine representatives in Luxembourg, where the two sides discussed the Kuromorimine territory occupied by BC Freedom after WWII.

 bcfreedom_kga_issue.3.t:0 "Negotiations begin"
 bcfreedom_kga_issue.3.d:0 "We have conducted negotiations with Kuromorimine in its tense atmosphere, both sides know that no other consensus can be reached until the territory is settled, which is the main purpose of this negotiation, how do we reply to each other?"

 bcfreedom_kga_issue.5.t:0 "Additional war reparations"
 bcfreedom_kga_issue.5.d:0 "Although BC Freedom was willing to give back our occupied territories in the negotiations, it was not free.

 bcfreedom_pra_issue.3.d:0 "BC Freedom and Pravda are located at opposite ends of the European continent, and there are still heavy obstacles between the two countries.

 bcfreedom_pra_issue.4.t:0 "Eastern European issues"
 bcfreedom_pra_issue.4.d:0 "After talking about the revolutionary situation, both sides turned their attention to the more realistic problem of Bonple, the other great victor of World War II. Pravda had always wanted to bring the fire of revolution to Warsaw, but Bonple's close ties are well known, and we must take a stand on this issue; if we decide to Continuation support Bonple will probably make it difficult to proceed with the talks and cooperation with Pravda will not be fully developed."
 bcfreedom_pra_issue.4.a:0 "Bonple where as reliable as Pravda, we don't need to invest a lot of resources there anymore."
 bcfreedom_pra_issue.4.b:0 "Bonple is our traditional ally, and besides, who knows what will happen when Pravda sits on top?"

 bcfreedom_pra_issue.7.d:0 "Kuromorimine is our great enemy, and despite their heavy losses in the last great war, they still have notable strength. We don't have enough strength to be able to defeat them completely. If Pravda is willing to work with our country to isolate Kuromorimine, or simply remain neutral, both can greatly reduce our pressure."

 bcfreedom_andou.4.d:0 "As a member of the student council, Ando nominated members of her faction as new members of the student council today. This will undoubtedly strengthen its influence, but we can also use it to appease Ando Party and avoid further trouble . Ultimately, how do we decide?"

 bcfreedom_andou.5.t:0 "Ando proposes to buy a new chariot "
 bcfreedom_andou.5.d:0 "The combat vehicles currently used by our university have gradually become difficult to meet the demands of modern warfare, and Ando, who advocates mobility as the mainstay, proposes to purchase more advanced light tanks to increase our combat power.

The main point of this conference was to discuss the expansion of the powers of the central government - something that is very difficult in present-day France.

 bcfreedom_civil_war.5.d:0 "The protracted confrontation has finally erupted in the most violent way; France has been completely divided and the war for supremacy around the struggle for the supremacy of France has been fought. This undoubtedly announces the collapse of the post-WWII European order centered on BC freedom. Neither SaintGloriana nor Kuromorimine has made clear at this point whether they will intervene in this civil war. In any case, this civil war will determine the fate of France and Europe as a whole."

A shattered France is now back under one roof, but it remains unclear whether it will ever return to its pre-war status. With the advent of peace, the militia returned to the field and the reconstruction of the country began to take its course. The Order of St. Joan of Arc has contributed greatly to the unification of the country, but its status has become delicate in the post-war period, and it will be up to the Virgin Marie to decide whether to extend the rule of theocracy to the whole country or to raise the banner of BC freedom again."
