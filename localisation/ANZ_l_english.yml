 Anzio.3.t:0 "The New Renaissance"
 Anzio.3.d:0 "Driven by a trend of exploration of Anzio's modern society and culture by the Catholic-Democratic school, the political overtones of Anzio society, the humanist ideology, and the whims of the modern scientology are organically combined in a wonderful chemical reaction.

 Anzio.4.t:0 "Gakushin challenges the Church and the Communist Party"

 Anzio.10.c:0 "With the rise of communist forces and the compromise of the TDP, the Anzio Communist Party was fomenting a new secularization movement, but there was a growing desire among the people to break with the obscurantism it represented, but the two created an irreconcilable conflict and eventually led to a parting of the ways between the Communist Party and the people."

 Anzio.15.t:0 "Nero's Syndrome"
 Anzio.15.d:0 "Anzio's great leader, Anchovy, has recently been in her residence for a long time, refusing to see anyone, seemingly having lost a clear purpose since her success in gaining the trust of Anzio's society, and now all she has in mind is the future destination of Anzio, which since the end of the last great war seems to have apparently gained huge territories and reparations, but in reality the Roman nation of the Mediterranean is still waiting for a new order of great unity, and this time, when will the knot in her heart be untied..."
 Anzio.15.a:0 "Strive until the time of the unity of the Mediterranean nations"
 Anzio.16.t:0 "Anchovy recovers"
 Anzio.16.d:0 "At last, when the return of the great empire was ushered in, an incomparable and unprecedented smile spread from her face. This great achievement was like a spring breeze that blew away from the shoulders of the Führer all the fatigue and weakness that had accumulated during the day and night of the country's work, so that Anchovy finally regained her daily vitality and loveliness, and if she is not the same as before, she is now the most beloved Senshado who has accomplished the most majestic work!"
 Anzio.16.a:0 "I love it so much"
 Anzio.17.t:0 "Nero's syndrome in its advanced stage"
 Anzio.17.d:0 "Her greatness was unmatched, her forward thinking led the age, she labored day and night for the future of the great empire, but even a battle-hardened lion cannot resist the passage of time and the mountains of problems, let alone a woman in her prime, and the overwhelmed Anchovy could not survive the heart disease and left permanent But she still has you. If she had a chance to start over, would you still let her bear such a burden alone?"
 Anzio.17.a:0 "..."
 Anzio.18.t:0 "substance abuse"
 Anzio.18.d:0" If it is said that a pill is three times more poisonous, then the intensity of Anchovy's medication has now far exceeded the level of poisoning herself... But if we leave the suppression of the drug, her thoughts, her hang-ups are like a long sharp sword hanging over her head, and when that obsession breaks out, no one will be able to guard this powerful woman. All we can do is to heal her before that happens, though it is already a little late..."
 Anzio.18.a:0 "I only hope that I will not experience the cold of winter and the warmth of spring"
 Anzio.19.t:0 "A little consolation"
 Anzio.19.d:0 "After a tour on the borders of the new empire, a little consolation emerged from the leader's face, like a warm breeze blowing before the end of winter, but there was clearly a bumpy road to travel before the true renaissance of the Mediterranean nation. \nWhile going further and further on this great journey, Anchovy was also growing into a man of his time who was truly fit to lead the empire forward."
 Anzio.19.a:0 "Anzio isn't weak... No, it's very strong!"
 Anzio.20.t:0 "Medicated means of treatment"
 Anzio.20.d:0 "Just when the expert treatment teams in the country were at their wits' end even for the Führer's heart condition, a new powerful antidepressant with no proven efficacy circulating in the gray market was discovered, which, perhaps, could be an opportunity to treat Nero's syndrome, or at least it could act as a delayed attack... But because of its unpublishable ingredients must be extremely harmful drugs for humans."
 Anzio.20.a:0 "At least a means of delay"
 Anzio.21.t:0 "The symptoms were relieved"
 Anzio.21.d:0 "After Anchovy took the new drug, her mental state apparently improved a little, and the great revival of the Mediterranean nation and Rome had to be brought up urgently, the drug could only mention a relieving effect, and no one could say what the result would be if it was overdosed."

 Anzio.22.t:0 "Swiss regional electricity export matters"
