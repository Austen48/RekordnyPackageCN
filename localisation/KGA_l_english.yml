 kuromorimine.64.a:0 "For our part, we have to prove that this is the case"
 kuromorimine.65.t:0 "Clean house"
 kuromorimine.65.d:0 "Soon after the new Berlin regime was established, word spread quickly and a backlash from the Nishizumi family forces soon arrived, but given the discontent within the army towards Nishizumi Miho, they didn't get much real help, and we soon captured Nishizumi Maho and the senior generals who supported her along with the high standing officials of the Federation."
 kuromorimine.65.a:0 "We need a fair trial."
 kuromorimine.66.t:0 "The secret trial of Nishizumi Maho"
 kuromorimine.66.d:0 "She is like the last evil dragon in the world, lonely but still full of power and hatred, looking viciously at her enemies but not saying a word, the aura of a king and the last stubbornness of the Nishizumi family. \nErika's eyes wavered, in fact, she knew what she should do and say, but in this hot gaze, she saw the worship and belief, the former idol was easily defeated by themselves, but did not know how to decide Maho's stay or departure. \nMaybe she is just showing the last tender with a gray future, Erika thought so, her team is well-trained, she acts calmly and decisively, she knows herself better than any of them. \nBut if at this juncture she abandons her ambitious goals and vision simply because of personal feelings, with what attitude will she treat her supporters and the already betrayed Miho?And how will she regroup Kuromorimine from this fertile ground."
 kuromorimine.66.a:0 "Exile Maho and destroy Nishizumi Style once and for all"
 kuromorimine.66.b:0 "Retain Nishizumi Style's place in the domestic Senshado"
 kuromorimine.67.t:0 "Twilight of Nishizumi Style"
 kuromorimine.67.d:0 "Even if Kuromorimine is restored to a political order even more than before, it can no longer recover from the previous blow of the prestigious Senshado, and the blow to its reputation and family prestige it suffered leaves Nishizumi Maho to barely run the Nishizumi family. \n The Nishizumi of today is just a medal of the Senshado glory of yesteryear."
 kuromorimine.67.a:0 "Once a gentleman, once a minister"
 kuromorimine.68.t:0 "The Trial of the Remnant of Maho: Mauko"
 kuromorimine.68.d:0 "Mauko was the commander of the heavy chariot unit, but she showed compassion for the Nishizumi family at every turn in this trial, and had a relatively uncontrollable temper, making her an elusive officer."
 kuromorimine.68.a:0 "Remove her from the government"
 kuromorimine.68.b:0 "retain his position"
 kuromorimine.69.t:0 "Trial of Maho's remaining party: Sanko"
 kuromorimine.69.d:0 "Sanko is a low ranking military commander and very timid in her dealings, she was involved in this trial because she was overly cautious in not cutting ties with Nishizumi Style in time, might be good scapegoat given that she has few strengths and weaknesses."
 kuromorimine.69.a:0 "remove her from the government"
 kuromorimine.69.b:0 "retain her position"
 kuromorimine.70.t:0 "Trial of Maho's remaining party: Geshiko"
 kuromorimine.70.d:0 "Geshiko is the commander of the Mid-Tan Chariot unit, her conformity and loyalty to Nishizumi Style made her suffer a lot in this trial, but her efficiency in carrying out her tasks has always been excellent."
 kuromorimine.70.a:0 "Remove her from the government"
 kuromorimine.70.b:0 "retain his position"
 kuromorimine.71.t:0 "Trial of the Maho Remnant: Kojima"
 kuromorimine.71.d:0 "Kojima served as Maho's former assault gun car chief and political supporter, but soon cut ties with Nishizumi Maho in the trial, but there is information that she still has dealings with the remnants of the Ooarai Student Union."
 kuromorimine.71.a:0 "Remove her from government"
 kuromorimine.71.b:0 "Retain her in her position"
 kuromorimine.72.t:0 "Nishizumi Style is completely removed"
 kuromorimine.72.d:0 "An operation to break up the remnants of the Nishizumi family's influence was approved, and it was only then that people were surprised to discover that every aspect of Kuromorimine society had long been infiltrated and monopolized by Nishizumi's forces, whether it was medical care, manufacturing or education, and the ruthless black hand behind the scenes could be glimpsed."
 kuromorimine.72.a:0 "Drive them and those shameless supporters out of Kuromorimine."
 kuromorimine.73.t:0 "Kuromorimine demands the return of Tyrol"
 kuromorimine.73.d:0 "Kuromorimine seems to have a grudge against the southern part of Tyrol that we have been controlling, and today they gave an ultimatum that we return Tyrol in the common interest of both countries, or face the consequences."
 kuromorimine.73.a:0 "Give it back to them."
 kuromorimine.73.b:0 "I'd like to see what the consequences are"
 kuromorimine.74.t:0 "Anzio agrees to return South Tyrol"
 kuromorimine.74.d:0 "Anzio agreed to our demands and South Tyrol is once again back in the arms of Mother Germany."
 kuromorimine.74.a:0 "Hurrah"
 kuromorimine.75.t:0 "Anzio refuses to return South Tyrol"
 kuromorimine.75.d:0 "Anzio refused our request."
 kuromorimine.75.a:0 "It seems that a good diet has made these weaklings unable to distinguish themselves"
 kuromorimine.79.t:0 "The treatment of the Kuromorimine people of Jutland is a problem"
 kuromorimine.79.d:0 "After investigation and media news feedback, we have basically established that Kuromorimine people under the Grand Duchy of Viggen are being treated unequally in terms of policies and human rights, AkaboshiKoume has drawn up programs to help those who can become Kuromorimine citizens to get passports or citizenship, and we should demand that Jutland be demilitarized as a buffer zone between us and the Grand Duchy of Viggen, to prevent the military from being stationed in the same way that would guarantee the well-being of the people of Jutland from the oppression of the powerful."
 kuromorimine.79.a:0 "Send the proposal."
 kuromorimine.76.t:0 "The treatment of the Kuromorimine people of Jutland"
 kuromorimine.76.d:0 "Kuromorimine demands that Jutland be made a demilitarized zone and that citizenship clearance be granted to those in Jutland willing to naturalize, what should we do with this unfair proposal?"
 kuromorimine.76.a:0 "That's just bullshit."
 kuromorimine.76.b:0 "We'll just have to agree with them ah"
 kuromorimine.77.t:0 "The request was denied"
 kuromorimine.77.d:0 "The request we sent to the Grand Duchy of Viggen for an immigration program and protection of the collar was sternly rejected, they seem to be still unhappy with this unfair treatment they imposed on our people"
 kuromorimine.77.a:0 "Then don't blame us for being tough"
 kuromorimine.78.t:0 "The Grand Duchy of Viggen gives in"
 kuromorimine.78.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Viggen agreed to our proposal, and now our entry routes and immigration screening are open for the people of Jutland, while the Grand Duchy of Viggen has withdrawn its troops from Jutland to ensure treatment issues."
 kuromorimine.78.a:0 "I think we can be friends too"
 kuromorimine.80.t:0 "Independence strategy of the Crown Lords of Liveland"
 kuromorimine.80.d:0 "The old Ooarai momo gives Kuromorimine a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity if we have established a strategy for the Baltic and New Senshado alliances. the Liveland Crown Collar, as the rightful successor to the Baltic, is now in danger of being erased by Bonple from its history and national In danger of being erased from history and culture by Bonple, momo hopes we can help her re-establish Liveland's rightful government, which of course will not be without a military conflict, but the Livelanders will be our closest comrades in arms."
 kuromorimine.80.a:0 "It's time to give those ethnic cleansers a piece of your mind."
