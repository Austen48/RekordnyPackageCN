 SDS_1972_DESC:0 "Saunders University High School, a Senshado College with a strong American flavor. As the Senshado League grew in international reputation and influence, it naturally became the sole legitimate government of the United States after the war. The good times did not last long, and with the split of the various Senshado League members, the Senshado League was dead in name only. The dramatic international upheaval accelerated the divisions and rivalries among the various nations, and the Key government gradually lost its former influence. In addition to the Democrat-Republican disputes, the growing populist and communist divisions and conflicts grew. A strand of populists, the Gilbert Party, took advantage of the situation to unite some Republicans and members of the 3K Party in the South. With the Kennedy assassination in 1963, the conspiracy theorists rightfully received the most votes in 1964. Will the Gilbert Party be able to seize the opportunity to wipe out the opposition and will Key be able to find a way out of this dilemma and lead America into the light?"
