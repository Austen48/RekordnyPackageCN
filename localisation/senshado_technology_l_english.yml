Development began in 1941 in Germany on the basis of the Pz.Sfl.IVc chassis. The development process encountered many difficulties and the handling system of the fighting vehicle was constantly changed until 1944 when the FlaK 41 gun was successfully mounted on the vehicle. This design eventually became the basis and replacement for other derivative vehicles that followed. The program was ultimately not completed and only three prototypes exist."
