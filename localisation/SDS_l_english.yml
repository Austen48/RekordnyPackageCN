 Saunders.1.t:0 "Saunders' current situation"
 Saunders.1.d:0 "The United States has been in decline since the election of the Gilbert Party in 1964. On the one hand, many European countries, especially Saint Gloriana, did not really see it as an ally due to the erection of new trade barriers and nationalistic policies. On the other hand, the growing opposition to Gilbert's policies, coupled with a long history of repressive domestic policies, left the population exhausted. Eventually, Key formed a new political party, and under the influence of the raging public opinion, Gilbert's government could no longer stop the campaign. However, although Gilbert lost the support of most people, she did not lose the support of everyone, at least not everyone. The future of America is at stake. Maybe Key will win the election, or maybe Gilbert will rise again, but no one knows the final future."
 Saunders.1.a:0 "May God bless America!"
 Saunders.2.t:0 "The intensifying economic crisis"
 Saunders.2.d:0 "The economic downturn caused by the oil shortage has finally triggered an economic crisis, a disaster that is rapidly expanding in scope due to a prolonged domestic downturn and a decline in government credibility, a fire that will soon burn down on our own heads if we don't do something about it."
 Saunders.2.a:0 "Oh my God!" 
 Saunders.3.t:0 "American Chariot Coalition Party"
 Saunders.3.d:0 "The Chariot Coalition Party of America was formed on 1970.1.17, headed by Key, who united most of the former Senshado coalition members in the country to fight the Gilbert party. As time passed, Key gradually gained ground in the polls. By this time, on August 2, 1971, with the onset of an economic crisis, the workers' movement, which had subsided in the country, was revived and leftist forces were in the ascendant. The general election would soon begin, and the fate of the United States was at stake."
 Saunders.3.a:0 "Let the light of democracy shine again"
 Saunders.4.t:0 "The Civil Rights Crisis"
 Saunders.4.d:0 "Although the turmoil caused by the civil rights crisis subsided temporarily a few years ago, it is clear that the winds of civil rights have not yet completely dissipated. the economic crisis of 1972 objectively fueled the power of the marchers. The issue of civil rights was unofficially on the agenda, and if the Gilbert administration did not address it, someone else would."
 Saunders.4.a:0 "The winds of civil rights are gradually blowing away the veil of hypocrisy."
 Saunders.5.t:0 "New Year"
 Saunders.5.d:0 "The marching and striking workers have piled up in the streets, and facing them are the baton wielding private police who are trying to stop that riotous workers from storming the venue to avoid causing chaos at the government speech, but I guess they won't last long."
 Saunders.5.a:0 "Happy New Year"
 Saunders.6.t:0 "Secret message"
 Saunders.6.d:0 "Our informants in the higher echelons of the government have brought us the not-so-reliable news that Gilbert seems to have reached a compromise with the people involved and they have decided to attack those crowds before the next march as a way of dampening the growing morale of the left."
 Saunders.6.a:0 "Inform the marching crowds, we can't be bystanders!"
 Saunders.6.b:0 "There is no reliability to this information, we don't have the energy to waste on this disinformation."
 Saunders.7.t:0 "A tragedy that was successfully avoided"
 Saunders.7.d:0 "Just this afternoon, there was indeed a large number of armed police and military outside the window. Fortunately, we warned them in advance, otherwise, I'm afraid the whole street would have been stained red..."
 Saunders.7.a:0 "We managed to avoid a tragedy"
 Saunders.8.t:0 "An unimaginable tragedy"
 Saunders.8.d:0 "Just this afternoon, the windows were still filled with marching crowds as usual. Suddenly there was a loud noise, followed by gunfire and the screams of the crowd. The sound continued for a full 2 hours before the streets finally quieted down, leaving only bodies and body bags..."
 Saunders.8.a:0 "How is this possible..."
 Saunders.9.t:0 "Tense Key"
 Saunders.9.d:0 "Whatever the outcome, it was now obvious that the Gilbert government had tried to solve this crisis through violence, just like last time.Key looked anxiously at the papers on the table, knowing that, no matter what, as far as this incident was concerned, he could no longer compromise as he had before, and she had to let everyone know where she, and her party, stood. "
 Saunders.9.a:0 "We have no choice"
 Saunders.10.t:0 "Press conference"
 Saunders.10.d:0 "The Chariot Coalition Party of America held a press conference this morning, and oddly enough, it wasn't Key who took the stage this time to speak, but his aide. \The aide had a lot of sweat on her face and what almost everyone could see was that she was so nervous that she even trembled a bit while reading the script, but she finished her speech well until the end. \Contrary to the aide's relaxed state, almost all the journalists present broke out in a cold sweat. This was not a simple speech, and it was easy to see that Key and her party had almost completely abandoned their previous peaceful campaigning attitude and were pushing themselves almost completely against the Gilbert Party"
 Saunders.10.a:0 "We must now make our position clear!"
 Saunders.11.t:0 "A united front"
 Saunders.11.d:0 "In this crisis situation, we could be declared an illegal party by the government at any moment. Even though we are the second largest party in Congress, shockingly, our influence in American society is minimal, and almost all of our intelligence comes from unofficial members of the party. We should unite all the forces we can in order to deal with this crisis, whether he is a plutocrat or another party, as long as he is a progressive party or figurehead, we should all unite and work together to fight the Gilbert administration in the election."
 Saunders.11.a:0 "We need to unite all the forces that can unite"
 Saunders.12.t:0 "Thoughts on those on the left"
 Saunders.12.d:0 "There are a large number of left-wing intellectuals in our party. In fact, despite our outward denials, we do have many former members of the Communist Party USA and the Labor Party within us. Together, these leftists and we have garnered broad mass support at the local level."
 Saunders.12.a:0 "A certain amount of cooperation"
 Saunders.12.b:0 "full cooperation"
 Saunders.13.t:0 "Perceptions of plutocracy"
 Saunders.13.d:0 "While most plutocrats are villains in this national disaster, there must be a few that are not, right? \nWe must enlist the support of plutocrats and giants or our funding sources will be cut off, especially at such a time of crisis."
 Saunders.13.a:0 "Enlist the support of sympathizers"
 Saunders.13.b:0 "Promising benefits and concessions"
 Saunders.14.t:0 "Perceptions of former Senshado coalition members"
 Saunders.14.d:0 "The most dominant group of people in our party are the former members of the Senshado coalition, even his leader - Key is one of them. They are also the ones who have participated and been injured and sacrificed the most in our many operations, so maybe we should give some subsidies to reward them for their efforts?"
 Saunders.14.a:0 "She and everyone else should be treated the same way"
 Saunders.14.b:0 "They will have some welfare policy"
 Saunders.15.t:0 "Election day"
 Saunders.15.d:0 "Today is an extraordinary day, and today's election determines the future of this country. Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the results to be released."
 Saunders.15.a:0 "Hold your breath"
 Saunders.16.t:0 "The results are..."
 Saunders.16.d:0 "The result of the election is that Key's party has won the election! Everyone, including Key himself, shouted out in excitement. Everyone, including Key himself, shouted with excitement. The streets were filled with people marching in celebration."
 Saunders.16.a:0 "There is no doubt about it."
 Saunders.17.t:0 "Secret telegram"
 Saunders.17.d:0 "At the inauguration ceremony on the day after election day, a surprising piece of news came out from an informant - many of the top brass in Gilbert's administration were nowhere to be found. Although this is not a big deal, an ominous cloud rises in Key's mind."
 Saunders.17.a:0 "What do they want?"
 Saunders.18.t:0 "Strange things"
 Saunders.18.d:0 "During the days Key was in office, a number of companies relocated their businesses to the west in the name of supporting the development of backward areas, and due to his busy schedule, Key did not notice the documents until December. This undoubtedly played a role in pushing forward the development law for Saunders' western minerals, yet one cannot help but be puzzled at such a time."
 Saunders.18.a:0 "What is this fight, wait, it can't be ......"
 Saunders.19.t:0 "A dark cloud looms over the United States of America"
 Saunders.19.d:0 "Key guessed right, but it's too late. Just this afternoon, a vast swath of land, including the western United States, declared independence, declaring a new government in rebellion against the tyranny of the new administration, and it's not hard to guess who's behind them"
 Saunders.19.a:0 "Gilbert, is it ......"
 Saunders.20.t:0 "Chihatan independence!"
 Saunders.20.d:0 "Today the divided Saunders is much less influential than before, and just today the Saunders Army in Chihatan was evacuated in an emergency to defend against a crisis in the homeland, and then Chihatan took advantage of the situation to declare independence."
 Saunders.20.a:0 "Oh no."
 Saunders.21.t:0 "Hawaii becomes independent with the Central American Independent Commonwealth!"
 Saunders.21.d:0 "Just after our colony in Chihatan went independent, Hawaii followed suit and formed a new federal state with the Ooarai-controlled Central American Confederation of New Mexico, and the mastermind of this independence turned out to be our once closest comrade in arms, alisa, who has long since disappeared after transferring some of her gold a few days ago."
 Saunders.21.a:0 "Big bad news in the sky"
 Saunders.22.t:0 "Civil war broke out"
 Saunders.22.d:0 "And on that note, for the second time, the American Civil War"
 Saunders.22.a:0 "It broke out ......"
 Saunders.23.t:0 "The success of the independence movement"
 Saunders.23.d:0 "As saber rattling surfaced in Saunders' land, the plutocrats and liberals seemed to deploy different levels of political and military deployment for the civil war. sovereignty."
 Saunders.23.a:0 "Anyway, this is good news for Chihatan."
 Saunders.24.t:0 "The turn of public opinion"
 Saunders.24.d:0 "News of our collaboration with the Communist Party USA has leaked out, which has had a bad effect on our reputation, excluding the strong condemnation from Gilbert and the right wing, and some companies with whom we had previously worked reasonably well have cut ties with us as well as sponsorship"
 Saunders.24.a:0 "Big bad news"
 Saunders.25.t:0 "Failed assassination"
 Saunders.25.d:0 "Tonight, Key was still in his room making final preparations before the election, and just as Key was practicing his speech to the window, the glass suddenly shattered with a crash, followed by a slight pain originating in his face, and when Key turned his head in shock to look back, all that was left on the wall was a black bullet hole."
 Saunders.25.a:0 "Quick ...... someone!"
 Saunders.26.t:0 "Disaster"
 Saunders.26.d:0 "Just when everyone was shocked at the failed assassination, something even more shocking came in that the former government - Gilbert - has sided with the right-wing scum to form an alliance against us and the left. They have declared independence this afternoon in a large part of the West."
 Saunders.26.a:0 "Disaster has struck"
 Saunders.27.t:0 "The plutocrats refuse to support us"
 Saunders.27.d:0 "Since we have chosen to cooperate fully with the members of the left, no matter what we say again, the corporations that were previously willing to sponsor us, as well as the rich and powerful, have withdrawn their support for us, and we can only pray that they will not provide aid to our opponents"
 Saunders.27.a:0 "A foregone conclusion."
